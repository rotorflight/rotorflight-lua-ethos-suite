# RFSuite Lua Scripts for Ethos

**Rotorflight** is a powerful flight control software suite built specifically for **single-rotor RC helicopters**. It is not designed for multirotors or airplanes. The software includes:

-   **Rotorflight Flight Controller Firmware**
    
-   **Rotorflight Configurator** ‚Äì used for flashing and configuring the flight controller
    
-   **Rotorflight Blackbox Explorer** ‚Äì for analyzing flight logs
    
-   **Rotorflight Lua Scripts** ‚Äì used to configure the flight controller directly from your transmitter
    

These scripts support the following transmitter operating systems:

-   **EdgeTX / OpenTX**
    
-   **Ethos** (this repository)
    

Rotorflight is based on **Betaflight 4.3**, but includes a wide range of advanced features optimized for helicopter flight. This version of Rotorflight is also referred to as **Rotorflight 2 (RF2)**.

----------

## What is RFSuite?

**RFSuite** is a touch-based, Lua-scripted GUI suite for the Ethos platform. It enables easy setup, tuning, and diagnostics of Rotorflight-based helicopters using supported FrSky transmitters. It offers:

-   Full touchscreen interface
    
-   FrSky and ELRS receiver compatibility
    
-   Multiple embedded tools and widgets
    

You can preview the experience using the interactive simulator:

This opens the RFSuite in your browser, showcasing its functionality within the Ethos UI.

## Lua Script Requirements

To use RFSuite, you'll need:

-   **Ethos 1.6.2 or later**
    
-   A compatible FrSky transmitter:
    
    -   X10, X12, X14, X18, X20, or Twin X Lite
        
-   A supported receiver:
    
    -   FrSky (Smartport or F.Port over ACCESS, ACCST, TD, TW)
        
    -   ExpressLRS (ELRS) modules supported by Ethos
        

----------

## Verified Compatible Receivers

RFSuite has been successfully tested on the following receiver models (with X10, X14, X18, X20, XLite):

-   TWMX
    
-   TD MX
    
-   R9 MX ACCESS
    
-   R9 Mini ACCESS
    
-   Archer RS / Archer Plus RS / RS Mini (ACCESS / F.Port)
    
-   RX6R ACCESS
    
-   R-XSR ACCESS / ACCST F.Port
    
-   ELRS (all versions)
    

----------

## Development Guide

To build and deploy RFSuite locally:

### Requirements

-   FrSky Simulator (Ethos)
    
-   Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
    
-   Python 3
    
-   Install tqdm and serial:
    
    ```bash
    pip install tqdm
    pip install serial
    ```
    

### Environment Variables

Configure the following system variables:

```bash
FRSKY_SIM_BIN = C:\Program Files (x86)\FrSky\Ethos\X18S\simulator.exe
FRSKY_SIM_SRC = C:\Program Files (x86)\FrSky\Ethos\X18S\scripts
FRSKY_REMOTE_SRC = F:\scripts
```

You may use a comma-separated list in `FRSKY_SIM_SRC` to deploy to multiple simulators simultaneously.

### VS Code Tasks

-   **SIM: Deploy** ‚Äì Pushes scripts to the simulator
    
-   **SIM: Deploy & Launch** ‚Äì Deploys and starts simulator with debug output
    
-   **Remote: Deploy** ‚Äì Installs scripts to a connected transmitter via USB
