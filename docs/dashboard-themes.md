## üì¶ Box Type Reference

You can use the following `type` values for each box in your theme‚Äôs `boxes` array. Each type has its own display logic and available options:

| `type`         | Description                                                                      | Box Options Used                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `telemetry`    | Telemetry sensor value (numeric or text, with units/transform)                   | `source`, `title`, `unit`, `transform`, etc.  |
| `text`         | Arbitrary text value, can use source or be static                                | `source`, `title`, `unit`, etc.               |
| `image`        | Display an image from a path or value                                            | `source` or `value` (path), `imagewidth`, etc.|
| `modelimage`   | Automatically show the current model‚Äôs image                                     | (auto-detects model)                          |
| `governor`     | Show Governor state from telemetry                                               | (auto)                                        |
| `craftname`    | Show current model/craft name                                                    | (auto)                                        |
| `apiversion`   | Show the API version of Rotorflight                                              | (auto)                                        |
| `session`      | Display a value from the session (use `source` for key)                          | `source` (e.g., `"rx_rssi"`), etc.            |
| `blackbox`     | Show Blackbox storage used/total                                                 | (auto, shows MB)                              |
| `function`     | Call a custom drawing function (`value` is your function)                        | `value = function(x, y, w, h) ... end`        |
| `gauge`        | Draw a gauge (bar, horizontal or vertical), fully customizable                   | See **Manual Gauge** below                    |
| `fuelgauge`    | **Simple:** Draw a ready-to-use fuel gauge with built-in thresholds and defaults | See **Simple Gauge** below                    |
| `voltagegauge` | **Simple:** Draw a ready-to-use voltage gauge with built-in thresholds and defaults| See **Simple Gauge** below                   |

**Example usage:**

```lua
{ type = "telemetry", source = "voltage", title = "VOLTAGE", unit = "V" }
{ type = "session", source = "rx_rssi", title = "RSSI" }
{ type = "governor", title = "Governor" }
{ type = "blackbox", title = "Blackbox" }
{ type = "fuelgauge", title = "Fuel", unit = "%", col = 1, row = 2 }
{ type = "voltagegauge", title = "Voltage", unit = "V", col = 2, row = 2 }
{ type = "function", value = function(x, y, w, h) lcd.drawText(x, y, "Custom!") end }
```

> All box types can also use: `col`, `row`, `offsetx','offsety',`colspan`, `rowspan`, `padding`, `color`, `bgcolor`, `title`, `unit`, `onpress`, and more.

## üÜï Box Selection, Keyboard & Touch Navigation

**Any box with an `onpress` handler is focusable/selectable.**
You can highlight and activate these boxes using a rotary/keyboard or by touch.

**Navigation:**
- **Rotary left/right**: Move selection between all boxes that define `onpress`.
- **Enter (OK/press)**: Activates the selected box‚Äôs `onpress`.
- **Exit**: Removes selection highlight.

**Touch:**
- Tapping a box with `onpress` will highlight it and fire its event, keeping selection in sync with rotary navigation.

#### Custom Highlight Style

Add the following to your theme‚Äôs `layout` table to customize highlight color/border:

```lua
layout = {
    ...,
    selectcolor = lcd.RGB(0, 200, 255),  -- Custom color (any lcd.RGB or named color)
    selectborder = 2                     -- Border thickness (pixels)
}
```
*If not set, defaults to yellow (255,255,0) and 4px thickness.*

## üñ≤Ô∏è Example Box with `onpress`

```lua
{
    col = 2, row = 2, type = "telemetry", title = "ALT",
    onpress = function(widget, box, x, y, cat, val)
        -- Custom behavior when box is selected or tapped
    end
}
```

> **Tip:** Touching a box moves the selection focus to that box, so rotary/enter continues from there. On non-touch radios, navigation still works with rotary/keypad.

## üõ†Ô∏è Gauges: Manual vs Simple Approach

There are **two ways** to add gauge bars to your dashboard, depending on your needs:

### 1. **Full Manual Gauge (`type = "gauge"`)**

- **Use for**: Full control and customization.
- **Must specify**: All relevant properties, thresholds, and styling.
- **Best for**: Advanced layouts, special threshold colors, or custom sources.

**Example:**
```lua
{
    type = "gauge",
    col = 1, row = 1,
    source = "fuel",
    gaugemin = 0,
    gaugemax = 100,
    gaugeorientation = "vertical",
    thresholds = {
        { value = 20,  color = "red",    textcolor = "white" },
        { value = 50,  color = "orange", textcolor = "black" }
    },
    gaugecolor = "green",
    title = "FUEL",
    unit = "%",
}
```

### 2. **Simple/Auto Gauge (`type = "fuelgauge"` or `type = "voltagegauge"`)**

- **Use for**: Quick setup with good defaults.
- **Automatically**: Applies common thresholds and styling (can still override).
- **Best for**: End users or quick layouts.

**Example:**
```lua
{ col = 1, row = 2, type = "fuelgauge", title = "Fuel", unit = "%", titlepos = "bottom", gaugeorientation = "vertical" }
{ col = 2, row = 2, type = "voltagegauge", title = "Voltage", unit = "V", titlepos = "bottom", gaugeorientation = "horizontal" }
```
You can override any parameter from the manual approach, but usually only `title`, `unit`, and `orientation` are needed.

## üìö Box and Layout Options (Common Across Types)

- **col, row**: Grid position (1-based, left-to-right/top-to-bottom).
- **colspan, rowspan**: (Optional) Span multiple columns or rows.
- **title, unit**: Label and unit display.
- **color, titlecolor, bgcolor**: Value/text/background color.
- **gaugemin, gaugemax**: Min/max value for bar fill (can be number or function).
- **gaugecolor, gaugebgcolor**: Main and background color of the gauge bar.
- **gaugeorientation**: `"vertical"` or `"horizontal"` (fill direction).
- **thresholds**: List of value breakpoints for dynamic color changes (see above).
- **padding, titlealign, valuealign**: Fine-tune spacing and alignment.
- **onpress**: Add a function to make any box selectable/clickable.

## üé® Theme Locations: System Themes vs User Themes

Rotorflight supports two distinct locations for dashboard themes:

### **System Themes**
- **Path:**  
  `/scripts/rfsuite/widgets/dashboard/themes/<themename>`
- **Description:**  
  System themes come pre-installed with Rotorflight. These serve as the built-in or default options, and provide a great starting point or reference for customizations.

### **User Themes**
- **Path:**  
  `/scripts/rfsuite.user/dashboard/<themename>`
- **Description:**  
  User themes are your personal, editable copies. To add a custom theme, simply place your theme folder here. User themes can be modified freely and will not be overwritten by updates.

> **Tip:** If a user theme and a system theme have the same name, both will appear in the theme selector‚Äîuser themes are clearly marked and can be prioritized as needed.

**How the theme selector works:**
- The dashboard will display both user and system themes when you choose a theme.
- Your selection is saved using a key like `user/themename` or `system/themename`, so the dashboard knows exactly where to look.
- You can safely test or modify themes in the user location without affecting system files.
