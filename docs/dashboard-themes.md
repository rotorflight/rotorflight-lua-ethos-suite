## üì¶ Box Type Reference

You can use the following `type` values for each box in your theme‚Äôs `boxes` array. Each type has its own display logic and available options:

| `type`         | Description                                                                         | Box Options Used                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `telemetry`    | Telemetry sensor value (numeric or text, with units/transform)                      | `source`, `title`, `unit`, `transform`, etc.   |
| `text`         | Arbitrary text value, can use source or be static                                   | `source`, `title`, `unit`, etc.                |
| `image`        | Display an image from a path or value                                               | `source` or `value` (path), `imagewidth`, etc. |
| `modelimage`   | Automatically show the current model‚Äôs image                                        | (auto-detects model)                           |
| `governor`     | Show Governor state from telemetry                                                  | (auto)                                         |
| `craftname`    | Show current model/craft name                                                       | (auto)                                         |
| `apiversion`   | Show the API version of Rotorflight                                                 | (auto)                                         |
| `session`      | Display a value from the session (use `source` for key)                             | `source` (e.g., `"rx_rssi"`), etc.             |
| `blackbox`     | Show Blackbox storage used/total                                                    | (auto, shows MB)                               |
| `function`     | Call a custom drawing function (`value` is your function)                           | `value = function(x, y, w, h) ... end`         |
| `gauge`        | Draw a gauge (bar, horizontal or vertical), fully customizable                      | See **Manual Gauge** below                     |
| `fuelgauge`    | **Simple:** Draw a ready-to-use fuel gauge with built-in thresholds and defaults    | See **Simple Gauge** below                     |
| `voltagegauge` | **Simple:** Draw a ready-to-use voltage gauge with built-in thresholds and defaults | See **Simple Gauge** below                     |

**Example usage:**

```lua
{ type = "telemetry", source = "voltage", title = "VOLTAGE", unit = "V" }
{ type = "session", source = "rx_rssi", title = "RSSI" }
{ type = "governor", title = "Governor" }
{ type = "blackbox", title = "Blackbox" }
{ type = "fuelgauge", title = "Fuel", unit = "%", col = 1, row = 2 }
{ type = "voltagegauge", title = "Voltage", unit = "V", col = 2, row = 2 }
{ type = "function", value = function(x, y, w, h) lcd.drawText(x, y, "Custom!") end }
```

> All box types can also use: `col`, `row`, `x_pct`, `y_pct`, `w_pct`, `h_pct`, `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`, `offsetx`, `offsety`, `colspan`, `rowspan`, `padding`, `color`, `bgcolor`, `title`, `unit`, `onpress`, and more.

## üÜï **Box Positioning and Sizing (2024 Update)**

Every box now supports **three placement modes**, in priority order:

1. **Percent-based**: Use `x_pct` and `y_pct` (optionally `w_pct`/`h_pct` for width/height) to place and size by percentage of the widget area.
2. **Pixel-based**: Use `x` and `y` (optionally `w`/`h`) to place and size in fixed pixels.
3. **Grid-based**: Use `col` and `row` (with optional `colspan`/`rowspan`) to use the classic grid.

The box rendering system will **auto-detect which style you use**‚Äîwhichever of these is set (in the above order) takes precedence.

**If you use percent or pixel positioning, specifying `w`/`h` (or `w_pct`/`h_pct`) is recommended** so you control the box size. If not specified, it defaults to a standard grid box size.

### **Examples:**

* **Percent-based (recommended for responsive UIs):**

  ```lua
  { type = "gauge", x_pct = 0.5, y_pct = 0.15, w_pct = 0.3, h_pct = 0.12, ... }
  -- 50% from left, 15% from top, 30% wide, 12% tall (all relative to dashboard area)
  ```
* **Pixel-based (absolute, not responsive):**

  ```lua
  { type = "image", x = 120, y = 40, w = 80, h = 60, ... }
  ```
* **Grid-based (classic style):**

  ```lua
  { type = "text", col = 2, row = 1, colspan = 2, rowspan = 1, ... }
  ```

**Tip:**

* If both percent and pixel or grid positions are present, the priority is: `x_pct`/`y_pct` > `x`/`y` > `col`/`row`.
* Use `w_pct`/`h_pct` with percent placement for fully responsive layouts.
* All sizing values default to the grid box size if not explicitly set.

## üÜï Box Selection, Keyboard & Touch Navigation

**Any box with an `onpress` handler is focusable/selectable.**
You can highlight and activate these boxes using a rotary/keyboard or by touch.

**Navigation:**

* **Rotary left/right**: Move selection between all boxes that define `onpress`.
* **Enter (OK/press)**: Activates the selected box‚Äôs `onpress`.
* **Exit**: Removes selection highlight.

**Touch:**

* Tapping a box with `onpress` will highlight it and fire its event, keeping selection in sync with rotary navigation.

#### Custom Highlight Style

Add the following to your theme‚Äôs `layout` table to customize highlight color/border:

```lua
layout = {
    ...,
    selectcolor = lcd.RGB(0, 200, 255),  -- Custom color (any lcd.RGB or named color)
    selectborder = 2                     -- Border thickness (pixels)
}
```

*If not set, defaults to yellow (255,255,0) and 4px thickness.*

---

## üñ≤Ô∏è Example Box with `onpress`

```lua
{
    col = 2, row = 2, type = "telemetry", title = "ALT",
    onpress = function(widget, box, x, y, cat, val)
        -- Custom behavior when box is selected or tapped
    end
}
```

> **Tip:** Touching a box moves the selection focus to that box, so rotary/enter continues from there. On non-touch radios, navigation still works with rotary/keypad.

## üõ†Ô∏è Gauges: Manual vs Simple Approach

There are **two ways** to add gauge bars to your dashboard, depending on your needs:

### 1. **Full Manual Gauge (`type = "gauge"`)**

* **Use for**: Full control and customization.
* **Must specify**: All relevant properties, thresholds, and styling.
* **Best for**: Advanced layouts, special threshold colors, or custom sources.

**Example:**

```lua
{
    type = "gauge",
    col = 1, row = 1,
    source = "fuel",
    gaugemin = 0,
    gaugemax = 100,
    gaugeorientation = "vertical",
    thresholds = {
        { value = 20,  color = "red",    textcolor = "white" },
        { value = 50,  color = "orange", textcolor = "black" }
    },
    gaugecolor = "green",
    title = "FUEL",
    unit = "%",
}
```

### 2. **Simple/Auto Gauge (`type = "fuelgauge"` or `type = "voltagegauge"`)**

* **Use for**: Quick setup with good defaults.
* **Automatically**: Applies common thresholds and styling (can still override).
* **Best for**: End users or quick layouts.

**Example:**

```lua
{ col = 1, row = 2, type = "fuelgauge", title = "Fuel", unit = "%", titlepos = "bottom", gaugeorientation = "vertical" }
{ col = 2, row = 2, type = "voltagegauge", title = "Voltage", unit = "V", titlepos = "bottom", gaugeorientation = "horizontal" }
```

You can override any parameter from the manual approach, but usually only `title`, `unit`, and `orientation` are needed.

## üìö Box and Layout Options (Common Across Types)

* **Position & Size:**

  * `x_pct`, `y_pct`, `w_pct`, `h_pct`: Position and size as a percent of the dashboard area (0‚Äì1 or 0‚Äì100).
  * `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`: Position and size in pixels (absolute, not responsive).
  * `col`, `row`, `colspan`, `rowspan`: Grid position (classic method).
* **title, unit**: Label and unit display.
* **color, titlecolor, bgcolor**: Value/text/background color.
* **gaugemin, gaugemax**: Min/max value for bar fill (can be number or function).
* **gaugecolor, gaugebgcolor**: Main and background color of the gauge bar.
* **gaugeorientation**: `"vertical"` or `"horizontal"` (fill direction).
* **thresholds**: List of value breakpoints for dynamic color changes (see above).
* **padding, titlealign, valuealign**: Fine-tune spacing and alignment.
* **onpress**: Add a function to make any box selectable/clickable.

## üé® Theme Locations: System Themes vs User Themes

Rotorflight supports two distinct locations for dashboard themes:

### **System Themes**

* **Path:**
  `/scripts/rfsuite/widgets/dashboard/themes/<themename>`
* **Description:**
  System themes come pre-installed with Rotorflight. These serve as the built-in or default options, and provide a great starting point or reference for customizations.

### **User Themes**

* **Path:**
  `/scripts/rfsuite.user/dashboard/<themename>`
* **Description:**
  User themes are your personal, editable copies. To add a custom theme, simply place your theme folder here. User themes can be modified freely and will not be overwritten by updates.

> **Tip:** If a user theme and a system theme have the same name, both will appear in the theme selector‚Äîuser themes are clearly marked and can be prioritized as needed.

**How the theme selector works:**

* The dashboard will display both user and system themes when you choose a theme.
* Your selection is saved using a key like `user/themename` or `system/themename`, so the dashboard knows exactly where to look.
* You can safely test or modify themes in the user location without affecting system files.
